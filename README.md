# webfishing-midi
cross-platform midi player for the webfishing guitar!\
**Warning** ⚠️: the code may or may not be slop, I am not experienced with midi format

## Installation & Usage
Linux users may need additional runtime dependencies see [here](https://github.com/enigo-rs/enigo?tab=readme-ov-file#runtime-dependencies)\
- Place your midi files in the `./midi` directory next to the executable
- Run webfishing-midi

As of now this has only been tested on Linux but I have taken care to use cross-platform libraries so it should work on all platforms

## Acknowledgements
- Got the note shifting idea/logic from [KevAquila](https://github.com/KevAquila/WEBFISHING-Guitar-Player) his code was used as reference
