# webfishing-midi
Run midi files on the webfishing guitar!\
**Warning** ⚠️: the code may or may not be slop, I am not experienced with midi format

## Installation & Usage
Linux users may need additional runtime dependencies see [here](https://github.com/enigo-rs/enigo?tab=readme-ov-file#runtime-dependencies)\
Just download and run! You must place midis in the `midi` directory next to the executable.

## Acknowledgements
- Got the note shifting idea/logic from [KevAquila](https://github.com/KevAquila/WEBFISHING-Guitar-Player) his code was used as reference
